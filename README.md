# asyncio-api
This project has the goal to make me practice making an asynchronous API with **Python** and **FastAPI**.

To make this work the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` is needed (or just `pip install asyncio` and `pip install aiohttp`).

I based the solution in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii7x4mpIhIs) although I made the JS version by myself (had some problems with request and aiohttp but that's past)
